% C. Scarlet
C. Scarlet greets you with a smile.
- Scarlet: Oh, inspector, I'm happy you called me in. It's important to clear my name. You see, I'm an artist, and I can't have my reputation ruin my career. 
* - You: Don't worry miss Scarlett, I won't let that happen.
* - You: A terrible thing just happened miss Scarlett, don't you think your career is not the most important thing right now? 
&
Scarlet looks down and bats her eyes at you.
- You: I'm gonna need your name, age and occupation.
- Scarlet: My name is Miss Clara Scarlet. I'm 25 and an artist, as I just said.
&
- You: What was your relation to the victim?
- Scarlet: He was my patron. He let me use the atelier in the garden. 
- You: Just that?
- Scarlet: Well, he also gave me a monthly allowance. 
- You: And you were his heir.
- Scarlet: Yes, yes. But that was just to guarantee I could continue making my art after he died.
&
- You: Did you have any problems with Lord Black? Were you unhappy about your arrangement?
- Scarlet: Well, no...
- You: You don't sound very convinced. 
- Scarlet: There was this one thing...
&
- You: Yes?
- Scarlet: We had a disagreement about the... kind of art I'd make. But it was very minor, really.
- You: What kind of art did he want you to make?
- Scarlet: Well, always the same really. Just the same boring colors and style. He didn't let me experiment.
&
- You: You sound quite angry about it. 
- Scarlet: Well yes, of course I was angry. I'm an artist, I never got the chance to explore my creativity. 
- You: And how can I know you didn't kill him?

% N. Mustard
Colonel Mustard enters the room with a stern face. That doesn't surprise you that much, because you've never seen him smile before. 
- You: Colonel, take a seat.
- Mustard: Hmm. 
&
- You: I'm gonna need your name, age and occupation.
- Mustard: I know how these things go inspector. I'm a military man. 
- You: Well then...
- Mustard: Name, Colonel Noah Mustard. Age, 42. Occupation, Colonel. Currently discharged. 
&
- You: Why were you discharged?
- Mustard: I don't see how that is relevant.
- You: I'm gonna need full collaboration, Colonel.
- Mustard: I was just serving my country, Sir.
- You: You're gonna have to tell me what happened, Colonel.
&
- Mustard: I killed a witness that was not to be killed.
- You: I see...
- Mustard: But I'm not the murderer. This happened during a military operation. The victim was acting out, I had no other option.
- You: I'll still have to look into that Colonel.
- Mustard: I understand.
&
- You: So what was your relationship to Lord Black?
- Mustard: I am his cousin. Was. 
- You: And your current residence is...?
- Mustard: I am staying at House Negonoform, yes.
- You: I understand you were a significant heir to Lord Black. Do you have income yourself?
&
- Mustard: Well, as I just said, I wasn't exactly honorably discharged. I don't currently have my own income.
- You: That sounds like a motive.
- Mustard: It isn't. He was about to write me out of the will.
- You: Why?
- Mustard: Because my cousin is a bloody poofter.

% F. Green
Reverend Green looks nervous when he enters the room.
- You: Reverend Green, please sit down.
- Green: Thank you, inspector.
- You: I'm gonna need your name, age and occupation.
- Green: My name is Reverend Green, I'll be 35 next month. I'm the minister of Lord Black's parrish. 
& 
- You: What was your relationship to the victim? 
- Green: Well, he would come to my parish every Sunday...
- You: I mean, personal relationship.
- Green: Oh. Well, we were friends I'd say. He has also donated quite some money in the past. 
- You: ...past?
&
- Green: Unfortunately, yes. I'll explain so you won't think I'm guilty. You see, Lord Black was very big on the numbers. And... One time the numbers didn't add up exactly. 
- You: In what way?
- Green: We went slightly over budget when buying our new Jesus on the Cross statue. It was very minor really, 0.1% percent of the total budget, but he got so angry over it he has refused to give us money since. 
&
- You: Did you depend on that money?
- Green: Oh, yes. He said he'd start the donations again at some point, but I've asked him three times already and he refused every single time. 
- You: And all that for 0.1%.
- Green: He'd said it was a symbol for our lack in perspective on current trends in religion, presentation skills and orientation on future projects.
&
- You: How angry were you about that? 
- Green: As I said, we depended on that money...
- You: So did you do anything with that anger?

% Guilty
- Green: No, what could I have done? I'm just a simple minister.
- You: I see...
&
% Not guilty
- Green: Well, let's just say... I hear a lot of things in the confession booth. If he hadn't died I'm sure I could've... persuaded him to continue giving us money.
- You: I see...
