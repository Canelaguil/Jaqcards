[ SNAKE IN THE GRASS
[ Chapter 1
&
Welcome to Sparta. You've just come home from a few years travelling through Persia, hunting down the last remains of the cult that has threatened you your whole life.
&
Your family welcomes you, and you're just preparing for a nice and cosy holiday at home when a messenger appears,
telling you the great Senemis is looking for a misthios. That isn't someone you can say no to, so you reluctantly go to his house.
&
Senemis is an old man, with a bitter expression on his face. He receives you in the hall of his house.
- Senemis: Ah, there you are. You are the misthios they call Eagle Bearer, wasn't it? What is your name?
* Alexios

- Senemis: Well, Alexios, I have a job for you. A very high profile job.
- You: High profile... in which circles?
- Senemis: In Greek circles, though he called himself Spartan once. Before he betrayed us all. And now he's trying to win back Athen's favor! He's a snake in the grass, a man who brings war and dispute everywhere he goes, a man who sweettalks everyone into being at his bidding.

- Senemis: Well, Kassandra, I have a job for you. A very high profile job. Do you think you're up for it?

That sounds suspiciously like a member of the cult you thought you destroyed.
- Senemis: Do you think you're up for it?
* An enemy of Sparta is my enemy.

* A job is a job.
* Yes. I think I know the kind...

- Senemis: Of course.
- You: What can you tell me about him?
- He is currently on Samos, trying to get in touch with the Athenian leadership there. Goes by the name of Deitomachos.
- You: How do I find him?
&
- Senemis: We have a guy there, Cleinias. An Athenian. Find him in the temple of Apollo, he will guide you in the right direction.
* Spartans and Athenians working together... A lot must have changed since I left Greece.
* I trust travel expenses are covered and a large fee will be waiting for me when I'm back?
* Alright. See you in a week.

Senemis smiles.
- Senemis: Safe travels.

You take the first ship to Samos and arrive there a day later. Samos is currently being held by Athenians. Do you try to blend it or do you dress as a Spartan?

When you finally arrive at the temple, dressed as an Athenian, you find Cleinias standing in the courtyard. Cleinias laughs when he sees you.

- Cleinias: No.
- You: Alright. I'll find out anyways. Where did you say I could find him?
&
- Cleinias: My spies have been keeping an eye on him these past weeks. He always takes a morning walk on the Agora, talking to various Athenians. You can recognize him by his purple robe.
- You: There aren't many people who can afford a purple robe.
- Cleinias: Indeed. Try to find him tomorrow and otherwise come find me here again. He needs to be dead by Friday.

- Cleinias: I guess that's true...

You take your leave and find yourself having to find some food and get a place to sleep. What do you do first?
* Get some food and go for a walk

* Go find a place to stay the night

You manage to grab one of the last spots in one of Samos' full inns and at a reasonable price too. Do you stay in or do you go for a walk?
* Stay in

* Go for a walk
&
You go for a walk, but it's already late and the streets are empty. You go back early, grab some food leftovers and go to bed early. The next morning you wake up fresh and set out to the agora in a good mood.
* Go to the agora

&
You stay in and have some food, but the other guests don't seem too eager to talk. They're mostly athenian army folk anyways, and you decide to go to bed early. The next morning you wake up fresh and set out to the agora in a good mood.
* Go to the agora

&
You get some food at a street vendor and take a stroll across the streets of the city of Samos. You notice a big presence of the athenian army.
* Ask someone about the army
* Continue walking
ju 2
&
A man on the street tells you the whole of the athenian army is now based on Samos. The capital is having trouble, and the army has about become independent from it. You ask for more information, but the man doesn't know more.
&
When you finally set out to find an inn it's late, and most of them are full. After a tiring search you get permission to stay in someone's stables for the night, but this does not exactly guarantee a good night's sleep. The next morning you set out to the agora in a bad mood.
&
You arrive at the agora early. There's a small, roofed in altar surrounded by trees at the edge of the agora. You climb on top, hidden by the shadows, and wait. When he comes at least you spot the purple robe and silver hair from miles away. It's not hard to recognize the person they belong too: it's your old friend Alkybiades.
&
A few years ago, before you found your family and your Spartan citizenship was restored, you used to do various jobs around Athens. Perikles was still alive at the time and you greatly respected him. That's also where you met his proteg√©e Alkybiades, who you respected less but still grew to like.
&
He was a brilliant general and rhetorican, overflowing with ideas and plots to reach his not-always-very-moral goals. He was a beautiful youth pining after Socrates and sleeping around with everyone around him in the meantime. You didn't see eye to eye on everything, but you grew very close as friends..
* Very good friends.
* Very good friends, and lovers.

But much has happened since then. Alkybiades had apparently spend some time in Sparta, which was weird to say the least, and what was he doing on Samos trying to talk to Athenians? What has he done to have people wanting to kill him?
* It doesn't matter. A job is a job.

You have to get him to talk to you, but he's walking across the public agora surrounded by guards. What do you do?
* You jump into some nearby bushes and whistle, hoping he'll come to you.
* You hide behind the altar and make yourself visible when he comes by.

* You call out his name and gesture for him to come to the temple.

&
The guards look up and slowly move to the bushes. Alkybiades has seen you and must have recognized you, but he doesn't do anything to stop the guards. And so you take them out one by one, trying not to gather too much attention. When you're done you turn to your old friend.

- You: In which case I just murdered a lot of people.
- Alkybiades: Yes. And I'd been looking for a way to get rid of them, so thanks.
- You: Why?

Alkybiades gestures you to sit down. You find a quiet spot off the busy ways of the Agora and away from the dead bodies of Alkybiades' guards. He stays in pensitive silence for a while before starting.

* It rings a bell...
* Yeah no I think I was somewhere in Asia at the time.


&
Alkybiades start his story describing his genius in very humble brags on the various cities he conquered for Athens. You sort of knew already, but he truly is brilliant both as general and diplomat. Everything was going well till he set out on that ambitious Sicilian expedition.
&
- Alkybiades: Let's say I was popular enough to get the people to vote for the expedition, but not enough for it to work. Days before we'd leave my enemies vandalized religious statues, and then people came forward with charges of blasphemy... Basically everything surrounding me was seen as cursed and a bad omen, my reputation was ruined. I should never have left.
* - You: But you did.
&
- Alkybiades: I had to. The expedition was my idea, I couldn't just pass on it. But while away my enemies took charge. The expedition wasn't going well, and then suddenly news reached me that I had been sentenced to death back in Athens. So naturally I fled.
* - You: Are you saying none of it was your fault?

- You: So why did Sparta kick you out?
&
- Alkybiades: First you should know I won considerable victories for Sparta. Considerable as in, Athen's treasury was empty and the city almost in ruins when I was done.
- You: You say that was all on you?
- Alkybiades: The ideas were all mine, I obviously didn't execute all of them. But I served Sparta well.
